# SAPHIR

A simple small PHP DynamoDB ODM. Made to be fast and tiny. Ideal for [serverless PHP functions](https://bref.sh).

You have to use [async-aws](https://async-aws.com/clients/dynamodb.html) or the [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php) in order to work with AWS DynamoDB!

## Example

```php
// todo
```
