# SAPPHIRE

A simple small PHP DynamoDB ODM. Made to be fast and tiny.
Ideal for [serverless PHP functions](https://bref.sh).

You have to use [async-aws](https://async-aws.com/clients/dynamodb.html)
or the [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php) in order to work with AWS DynamoDB!

### Requirements
- php: >=8.0
- composer: >=2.0

> The package is not installable with composer 1

## What does the library do?

You add Attributes to your PHP Classes and with the help of the
DynamoManager you can convert to PHP Object to an Array that the AWS-SDK or async-aws can work with and vice versa.

## Example

```php
// todo
```
